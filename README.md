# unity-halfedges

Unity halfedge handler and some applications based on it. 

## Applications 
### Curvature Culclation

Each of meshes below shows Gausian / Mean / Principal / Normal curvatures respectively.

### Smoothing Culclation
By solving the Poisson's equation on a halfedges it enables mesh smoothing.
